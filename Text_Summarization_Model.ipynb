            "Other studies have suggested that the virus may be airborne as well, with aerosols potentially being able to transmit the virus. The host protein neuropilin 1 (NRP1) may aid the virus in host cell entry using ACE2. During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, various names were used for the virus; some names used by different sources included \"the coronavirus\" or \"Wuhan coronavirus\". The virus previously had the provisional name 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). Differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS‑CoV‑2 suggest that humans may have been infected via an intermediate host; although the source of introduction into humans remains unknown. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event. Research into the natural reservoir of the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak has resulted in the discovery of many SARS-like bat coronaviruses, most originating in horseshoe bats.\n"
